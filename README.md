I'm currently a PhD student at Xiamen University, diving deep into the realm of medical imaging. My research primarily focuses on object detection in medical images, with a specific interest in vertebrae detection.

Here are some insights into my GitHub activities and interests:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on developing advanced algorithms for detecting objects within medical imaging, especially focusing on vertebrae in various imaging modalities.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m continuously learning more about deep learning techniques and their applications in improving medical diagnostic processes.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate with other researchers and developers who are passionate about medical image processing and AI in healthcare.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m seeking advice and insights from experts in machine learning and medical imaging to enhance my research.
- ðŸ’¬ Feel free to ask me about my research on vertebrae detection, challenges in medical imaging AI, or any general questions about pursuing a PhD in this field.
